# Activity: Getting Started with @boardname@

In this activity student will work with: 
* opening a game, game controls and playing a game
* creating a new game, Blocks vs Script
* "My Projects", game .png download, and creating a game link


## Concept: Opening a game

## Student Task 1: Playing Space Destroyer

### New Project

## Student Task 2: Starting your own game

### ~hint

@boardname@ saves a special image (.png) file that embeds the code in the file. The file looks like a typical thumbnail image when opened with an image viewer but when opened in @boardname@ it loads game code.

Each Browser is different with opening the location of the file download. Try in the student environment before the exercise. The key is to have the student save the files in a consistent location such as a named folder. Later, students will need to navigate to this location to open the file in @boardname@.

Common Browser Saving behavior:
* show download file at the browser bottom border (then click to open or to see save dialog) 
* present a dialog that has options for saving or opening

## Student Task 3: Importing your game

## Student Task 4: Sharing your game

## What did we learn?
1. What did the ``||sprites:say||`` block do when you added it to the game in task 2? 
2. Compare and contrast the two different ways that we saved our game; what are the benefits of each choice? Which do you think you would use if you wanted to email a game you made to your friend, and why would you make that decision?
3. Include the image created in task 2
4. Include the link created in task 4 here

### ~hint

### Possible Solutions:

1. It creates a bubble above the sprite that shows the given text.
2. Using a link allows you to share it easily, but links can be a pain to save. So saving it as a image allows you to easily keep track of many games that you have created. If you were to email a game to a friend, it would probably be easiest to share the link so that your friend can just click the link instead of downloading and then uploading the image

## Rubrics

### ~hint

Start on the left rubric column (5pts), if the work meets the rubric measurement continue to the right (7pts, 9pts, 10pts). Award the score of the right most rubric that is passed. This means that to get the highest score student must pass all previous rubrics.
